## 🖥️ Interface

The popup is organised into **4 tabs**:

| Tab | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| **Protections** | Toggle each bypass on or off individually |
| **Overlays** | View and restore elements hidden by the extension |
| **Scripts** | Create, edit and manage custom JavaScript snippets |
| **Settings** | Language, theme, save your own defaults, factory reset |

**Quick actions** in the toolbar:
- **Enable All / Disable All** — one-click toggle of all protections
- **Pick** — click any element on the page to hide it (Escape to cancel)

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
- Browser internal pages (`chrome://`, `about:`) cannot be modified
- Content gated server-side (never sent to your browser) cannot be recovered
- DevTools bypass is marked experimental — some very advanced detection methods may still work

## 📋 Changelog

### v3.0.0 — Current
- **Major release** — significant expansion of bypass coverage and reliability
- New protections against advanced content-restriction techniques used by modern websites
- Improved compatibility with sites using isolated component architectures (Web Components)
- Continued performance and stability work across all bypass layers

### v2.2.9
- Bug fixes and reliability improvements
- Enhanced bypass effectiveness
- Performance improvements

### v2.2.8
- **Stealth** — `nativeToStr` now uses a WeakMap + single `Function.prototype.toString` patch: patched functions no longer have an own `toString` property (`hasOwnProperty('toString') === false`), indistinguishable from native functions
- **New bypass** — `Selection.prototype.toString` protected: some sites override it to return `''` and silently empty copied text even when selection is visible
- **Bugfix** — debounce timers (`_debTimer`, `_ovlDebTimer`) not cleared in `teardown()`, causing residual callbacks after deactivation
- Performance: `Object.entries(ON)` cached as `_ON_ENTRIES` at module level
- `autoRemoveOverlays` calls `N.setProp` directly, avoiding self-interception through patched `setProperty`

### v2.2.7
- **Bugfix** — `console.log` was never restored when Console Protection was disabled
- **Bugfix** — `pointerdown`/`keydown` listeners for focus tracking were never removed by `teardown()`, leaving permanent traces
- **Bugfix** — `history.pushState`/`replaceState` were double-wrapped on each reactivation after teardown (now guarded with `_spaHooked` flag)
- **Bugfix** — `document.hidden`, `visibilityState` overrides were never restored when visibility bypass was disabled
- **New** — `window.matchMedia('print')` intercepted to prevent paywall sites from detecting print attempts
- Performance: `patchFocus`, `patchScroll`, `patchVisibility`, `patchConsole` now skip on unchanged state (no redundant re-assignment on every `applyAll`)
- `teardown()` now fully restores focus, scroll, visibility, console and matchMedia to native

### v2.2.6
- **Zero trace when inactive** — when all features are disabled, the extension performs a full `teardown()`: L4 event sentinels removed from the DOM, MutationObserver disconnected, SPA polling interval cleared, injected `<style>` removed, native `addEventListener` restored, `selectionchange` listener removed, all CSS prototype patches restored to native
- `anyActive()` gate on `applyAll()` and the bootstrap — if everything is off at startup, only `lockPatches()` runs (transparent L1 guard, no DOM or observer overhead)
- L4 sentinels are now deferred: created in memory at init, registered/removed dynamically based on active state
- On re-activation after teardown, all machinery restarts cleanly

### v2.2.5
- **Security** — overlay picker no longer sets detectable DOM attributes (`data-ua-ov-id`); replaced with an invisible WeakMap
- **Bugfix** — L2 `addEventListener` wrapper now uses a composite key (function + capture flag), fixing rare `removeEventListener` mismatches
- **New** — `document.designMode = 'on'` now intercepted when text selection bypass is active (previously bypassed `user-select`)
- **Performance** — overlay list postMessage debounced 50 ms; `validatePayload` short-circuits before `JSON.stringify`
- Internal overlay hide calls native `setProperty` directly, avoiding self-interception

### v2.2.4
- **Critical bugfix** — scroll jank on all pages resolved: L4 event sentinels were registered with `passive:false` on `wheel`/`touchmove` unconditionally, forcing the browser to suspend scroll optimization on every page even with everything disabled
- **Critical bugfix** — video players and framework pages broken: `lockPatches()` was locking `EventTarget.prototype.addEventListener` as non-writable, silently breaking zone.js (Angular), Vue reactivity, and video SDK initialisation
- `lockPatches` switched to accessor guard `{get, set:noop, configurable:true}` — less detectable, same protection against simple reassignment
- Internal message bus channels renamed to generic identifiers (less fingerprintable in MAIN world)
- `setProperty` hot path optimised: direct string comparison instead of regex

### v2.2.3
- **Security hardening** — L1/L2 bypass layers locked at startup, impossible to overwrite even via fresh iframe prototype restoration
- Inline style `!important` attacks (`setProperty` with `user-select:none`) now intercepted
- `adoptedStyleSheets` vector covered (`replaceSync`/`replace` patched)

### v2.2.2
- **Stability & effectiveness improvements** — additional bypass coverage without site breakage
- Selection change events now intercepted alongside select-start
- Scroll bypass extended to `scrollTo`/`scrollBy` programmatic calls (sites that force-scroll back to top)
- CSS live-lock: `insertRule` patched surgically — only global `*`/`body`/`html` rules re-adding `user-select:none` or `cursor:none` are blocked
- SPA navigation fallback: URL polling at 1 Hz covers frameworks that bypass History API
- Security: postMessage payload capped at 64 KB
- Performance: inline-handler selector string cached at module level

### v2.2.1
- **Stability improvements** — overlay auto-remove now preserves legitimate modals containing forms or interactive elements
- **Performance** — CSS injection cached (no DOM update if unchanged), overlay detection deferred to browser idle time
- **Visibility bypass** — `document.hasFocus()` now also spoofed

### v2.2.0
- **Major performance overhaul** — resolved critical memory leak causing 3GB+ RAM usage and browser crashes on media-heavy sites
- **Removed Cookie Manager and Resource Viewer panels** — replaced by native browser DevTools (F12 → Application / Network); this eliminates the need to intercept all network requests, dramatically reducing memory and CPU usage
- **Bug fixes** — resolved multiple bypass interactions that caused breakage on complex web pages
- **Improved reliability** of all bypass layers

### v2.1.0
- **Cookie Manager** — full floating panel with create / edit / delete / export / import
- **Resource & Script Viewer** — real-time XHR, Fetch, Script, CSS and Image tracker with block, view and download
- **Floating panels in Shadow DOM** — panels are injected directly into the page and are invisible to detection scripts
- **Cancel overlay picker** — press Escape or click the button again to cancel pick mode
- **Drag & Drop fix** — complete rewrite of the drag & drop bypass, now works on all sites
- **Security: authenticated message bus** — all internal messages require a rotating secret token; forged messages are silently ignored
- **Security: XSS-safe popup** — all user-controlled data is rendered via `textContent`, never `innerHTML`
- **Performance: debounced MutationObserver** — mutations are batched over 120 ms instead of firing on every DOM change
- **SPA navigation support** — bypasses are automatically re-applied after client-side route changes (React, Vue, Angular…)
- **CSS live-lock** — prevents pages from re-injecting restrictive CSS rules via `insertRule`
- **Periodic re-application** — a lightweight background sweep counters sites that restore restrictions on a timer
- **4-language UI** — French, English, Spanish, German
- **Light / Dark theme** — toggle in header or in Settings
- **Save custom defaults** — save your preferred configuration and restore it anytime
- **Factory reset** — restores the original extension configuration and removes all custom scripts

### v2.0.0
- Complete bypass engine rewrite (9 layers, Manifest V3, MAIN world injection)
- Overlay manager with visual picker and restore list
- Custom user scripts with 3 execution phases
- i18n system (4 languages)
- Dark / Light theme
- User-defined default settings + factory reset

### v1.0.0
- Initial release: right-click, text selection, clipboard, keyboard shortcuts, drag & drop, scroll unlock, print, cursor restore, auto overlay removal
